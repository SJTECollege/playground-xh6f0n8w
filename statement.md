# Welcome!

This Python template lets you get started quickly with a simple one-page playground.

```python runnable
p = 100000; # principle (initial capital)
i = (4.17)/100; # taxa de juros
n = 1 # number if periods

m = p*(1+(i*n)); # express√£o do montante final

print(m);
```

# Advanced usage

If you want a more complex example (external libraries, viewers...), use the [Advanced Python template](https://tech.io/select-repo/429)
